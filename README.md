11/4/2024 - JDK's attempt at building a website for Codecademy Portfolio Project

I really want to skip this project and move on but I know that's a bad idea for my coding development.
Therefore, I'm going to be giving it a shot.

#Website built with:#

*HTML
*CSS
*JavaScript (maybeeeee)

Thanks for checking it out.
